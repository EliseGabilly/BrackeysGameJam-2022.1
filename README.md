# BrackeysGameJam-2022.1
Game made in Unity for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 on the theme it's not real

The game is playable in brower here : https://kyofa.itch.io/nolwenn


I chose to use this theme to illustrate a complicated point of mental illness: the denial of its entourage that does not always consider these diseases as real. In addition to this, the controls, although simple (arrowkeys), will go against what you may have learn until now.

Story :

A metaphor for the doubts and problems caused by sickness, obstacles will block or slow down Nolwenn on her journey. Those made of stones appear at the loading of a level and you can't interact with them like insoluble problems. Wooden or ceramic obstacles appear as you go along, they can be destroyed if you hit them and represent more temporary but sometimes annoying issues.
