10,Magalie,Stop complicating your life...
15,Nolwenn,Everything feels wrong.
15,Magalie,What are you imagining again ?
15,Dark,You are making a fool of yourself.
15,Nolwenn,Who are you?!?
15,Dark,Me ? I'm your darker self, your mental health, your doubts and your struggles.
15,Nolwenn,You are the one making all of this?
15,Dark,Or are you ?
20,Nolwenn,I think I have a problem.
20,Magalie,What are you talking about?
20,Nolwenn,I think I have depression. Everything seem wrong.
20,Magalie,Impossible you are young and pretty. You just want to be interesting...
20,Dark,You really thought that she could help?

25,Magalie,Put yourself together. There are no obstacles. Your so-called depression, it's not real 
25,Dark,Haven't you understand ? She won't help. No-one will. You are alone.
30,Magalie,Stop faking it. No-one will believe you and your mental issues... That's not a real thing.

50,Magalie,So ? Did you stop faking this all ?
55,Dark,What if I wasn't real ? And you did make it up?
60,Magalie,Still struggling ? I told you, this is not real...
65,Nolwenn,Will this madness ever end ?
